# Application

Redfish application is the simple clone of Google Keep. We customized the default Create React App starter to support Linaria â€“ the CSS in JS library with zero runtime.

The `App.js` component is a good point to start create own app. Create something instead of a standart `NotesWrapper` component, which is the most important part of current application. Leave the `Logout.js` as it is. There is also an unused `Profile.js` container. Customize it if you need a profile page with custom setups.
