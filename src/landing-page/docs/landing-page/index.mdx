# Landing page

The Landing Page created with GatsbyJS, because It required to have robust SEO configuration, and code splitting. The best choice for that is Gatsby.

To make authentication queries and handle states, we use Apollo Client. The authentication token we store in local storage.

The best way to start exploring the landing page is the `gatsby-config.js` file. Look at plugins and their setups. Don't forget to place your credentials for Google Analytics and Guess JS plugins instead of defaults.

The `./docs` folder is where this .mdx article is located. This simple .mdx documentation were created using `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and `gatsby-node` API. Keep it if you need simple documentation or a blog.

All code located in the `./src` folder. Start with exploring pages. Feel free to delete unnecessary things.
