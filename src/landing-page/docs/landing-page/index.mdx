# Landing page

The best way to start exploring the landing page is the `gatsby-config.js` file. Look at plugins and their setups.

The `./docs` folder is where this .mdx article is located. This simple .mdx documentation were created using `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and `gatsby-node` API. Keep it if you need simple documentation or a blog.

All code located in the `./src` folder. Start with exploring pages. Feel free to delete unnecessary things.
