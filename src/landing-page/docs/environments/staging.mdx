# Staging environment

In this section, we establish a serverless staging environment. We assume that you already walked through the previous articles and have created a local and remote serverless development environment. We won't touch things like installing dependencies or ZEIT Now and AWS configurations.

## Domains

In this tutorial, we use a standard `your-app.netlify.com` domain, though we recommend using your custom domain and subdomains. We assume that you can create and configure them by yourself.

Go to the `django_server.settings.staging.py` file and edit the URLs section constants. Remember to keep a staging suffix in the server URL.

```python
# django_server/settings/staging.py
...
# URLs
SERVER_URL = 'https://your-app-name-staging.username.now.sh'
LANDING_URL = 'https://your-app-name-staging.netlify.com'
APPLICATION_URL = 'https://your-app-name-app-staging.netlify.com'
...
```

Paste the same URLs to the `.env.staging` file inside of the `landing-page` folder:

```shell
# landing-page/.env.staging
...
# URLs
GATSBY_APP_URL = "https://your-app-name-app-staging.netlify.com"
GATSBY_LANDING_URL = "https://your-app-name-staging.netlify.com"
GATSBY_SERVER_URL = "https://your-app-name-staging.username.now.sh"
...
```

Same for `react-app`:

```shell
# react-app/.env.staging

# URLs
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL = "https://your-app-name-staging.username.now.sh"
REACT_APP_LANDING_URL = "https://your-app-name-staging.netlify.com"
...
```

## AWS set up

Use the same setup algorithm as in the previous article. You can copy your AWS region and credentials setups from the `development.py` file unless you want to restrict access by providing different credentials.

```python
# settings/staging.py
...
# The AWS region to connect.
AWS_REGION = "eu-central-1"

# The AWS access key to use.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKVFR2GVEGBCY6V3BTXL"

# The AWS secret access key to use.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "jJW+H59ICNLhzANevfsSJvLolo/SVRNH5K43edmP"
...
```

## AWS S3 bucket

S3 service is the place where we collect static files. <br/>

- [Create S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) with settings from the previous `development` bucket. Paste the name to the `settings/development.py` file:

```python
# settings/staging.py
...
S3_BUCKET = "name-of-your-s3-bucket"
...
```

## AWS RDS set up

You already have a PostgreSQL server. Create a new database there for a staging environment. You can achieve that with [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). Use settings from `development.py` settings as a base and edit `settings.staging.py` file with credentials for a database you've created.

```python
# settings/staging.py
...
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'server_staging', # dbname
        'USER': 'username', # master username
        'PASSWORD': 'MllVzrRbc3EvT3S', # master password
        'HOST': 'aws-postgres-rds.c7fqrmwomayj.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com', # Endpoint
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
...
```

## Git branch

Change your branch to the staging, merge changes you've made in the development branch, and push code.

```shell
$ git push origin development
$ git checkout staging
$ git merge --no-ff development
$ git push origin staging
```

## Deploy and prepare Django server

Deploy in the same way as the development environment, use our python script:

```shell
python now.py
```

Your server should be live! Go to the browser and test it with a link you specified previously.

Apply migrations:

```shell
$ python -m django migrate --settings=django_server.settings.staging
```

Create a superuser:

```shell
$ python -m django createsuperuser --settings=django_server.settings.staging
```

Redfish sends emails to users, and there is should be a proper link. So please do the next:

- Log in to the Django admin as a superuser
- Go to `Sites` and edit the first instance
- Domain name set to `https://staging.landing-page-domain.com` and Display name to `staging.landing-page-domain.com`;
- Click save button

## Deploy Landing page

We recommend using Netlify's continuous deployment service. [Sign up](https://www.netlify.com/) and follow the next steps:

- Click `New site from Git` button;
- Pick GitHub;
- Give access to all of your repositories and pick the one you need;
- All fields in the form you see should be like this:
  - Branch to deploy: `staging`;
  - Build command: `npm run build:staging`;
  - Publish directory: `src/landing-page/public`;
- Click the `Deploy site` button;
- Go to `Site settings`;
- Pick `Build & deploy` menu item;
- Click `Edit settings` in the first Build settings section;
- Fill Base directory field with `src/landing-page` value and click `Save` button;
  Now set up a domain name:
- Click on the `Domain Management` menu item;
- From a more button of the default subdomain, pick `Edit site name`;
- Fill the field with the name you typed previously in settings. Something like `your-app-name-staging`;
  And finally, go to deploys and click **_Retry deploy_**

## Deploy React app

Follow the same procedure for the `react-app` folder. Here is a brief note for you:

- Branch: `staging`;
- Build command: `npm run build:staging`;
- Publish directory: `src/react-app/build`;
- The base directory `src/react-app`;
- Set own domain or edit a default subdomain to something like: `your-app-name-staging`;
- Don't forget to retry deployment.

# That's it, your application is live!
