# Introduction

In this walkthrough you will:

- Set up a development environment with a public repository, so you could share your work with the world and keep sensitive data safe;
- Learn how to adjust Redfish for own needs.
- Setup AWS credentials and services.
- Create a private production repository on GitHub, with continuous deployment setups for [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
