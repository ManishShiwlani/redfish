# Local development

In this section, we start with the base. We are going to set up a local development environment with a GitHub public repository, so you could share your code with the community and keep sensitive data safe. To start, you need to have `python3.6`, `npm`, and `git`.

## Getting started

Fork the [repo](https://github.com/guandjoy/redfish) and change the repository name to your own. Then clone it locally:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:username/your-app-name.git
$ cd your-app-name
```

## Django server

Install, create, and start a virtual environment to work with a Django server:

```shell
$ python3.6 -m pip install virtualenv
...
$ cd src/django_server/
$ virtualenv -p python3.6 venv
...
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Prepare settings. Duplicate and rename `settings_example` folder as `settings` withing the `django_server` app folder:

```shell
$ cp -r django_server/settings_example django_server/settings
```

Generate `SECRET_KEY`:

```shell
$ python redfish/generate_secret_key.py
Paste the next string to the settings.py SECRET_KEY constant
kpvmoz93s_3*rs7i*$t5-g%x5df7!vr(7=$ie2$6pj%!5=e*8@
```

Copy and paste it to the `SECRET_KEY` constant inside of the `settings/common.py` file:

```python
# settings/common.py
SECRET_KEY = 'kpvmoz93s_3*rs7i*$t5-g%x5df7!vr(7=$ie2$6pj%!5=e*8@'
```

Create a Google mail app password and set up an SMTP server:

- Go to google app passwords: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords. _Make sure you turned on 2-step verification. Google restricts app passwords for users who don't._
- Select app: `mail`;
- Select device: `Other (custom name)`;
- Fill the name, e.g., `redfish-django-server`;
- Press `Generate` button;
- Copy and paste the `password` to the `settings/common.py` file and provide your `GMail email`:

```python
# settings/common.py
...
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'example@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'vcnstblmegxxkvkf'
...
```

Apply migrations:

```shell
$ python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```

Create a superuser:

```shell
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
Provide username and password
```

## Install React App dependencies

```shell
$ cd ../react-app/
$ npm install
```

## And Landing Page dependencies as well

```shell
$ cd ../landing-page/
$ npm install
```

## Start development servers

We have three development servers here: **Django, Create React App, and GatsbyJS**. You can start them withing 3 console windows, or, as we highly recommend, withing [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/.github/README.md).

- ### Start with terminal windows

Prepare 3 terminal instances and start `django_server` in first:

```shell
$ cd src/django_server/
$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9000
```

Start `react-app` development server in second:

```shell
$ cd src/react-app/
$ npm start
```

And `landing-page` development server in third:

```shell
$ cd src/landing-page/
$ gatsby develop
```

- ### Start with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/.github/README.md) [alternative and preferable way].

We already made a python script, which creates tmux windows and starts Django, CRA, and GatsbyJS development servers.
_Note: Make sure that the location of your virtual environment is `/src/django_server/venv` folder_

Execute the `tmux.devlocal.py` script withing the root directory:

```shell
$ python tmux.devlocal.py
```

Read [tmux man](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1). Some basics to play with it:

- `ctrl+b` `w` - navigate through windows using `up` and `down` arrow keys;
- `ctrl+b` `d` - minimize tmux and save session;
- `$ tmux a` - back to tmux after minimize it;
- `ctrl+d` - terminate tmux and session;
- `ctrl+b` `[` - scroll through the content. Use `up` and `down` arrow keys and `esc` to exit mode;
- `ctrl+b` `c` - create new window.

## Change site's domain and display name

Redfish sends emails for users, and there is should be a proper link. So please do the next:

- Log in to the Django admin: http://localhost:9000/admin
- Go to `Sites` and edit the first instance
- Domain name set to `http://localhost:8000` and Display name to `localhost:8000.`
- Click save

## You are ready to develop locally!

Available endpoints for you:

- http://localhost:8000/ - landing page
- http://localhost:3000/ - application
- http://localhost:9000/graphql - IDE for exploring GraphQL
- http://localhost:9000/admin - Django admin
