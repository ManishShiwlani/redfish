# Serverless development

In this section, we establish a serverless development environment. We assume that you already walked through the previous article and have created a local development environment. We won't touch things like installing dependencies here.

# Git branch

The name of the environment we build is `development`, so our branch, settings file, and environment variables' section should have the same name. Checkout to the development branch:

```shell
$ git checkout development
```

## ZEIT Now setup

We host the Django server by ZEIT Now, a serverless platform. [Create an account](https://zeit.co/) there, if you don't have one.

Install Now with npm:

```shell
$ npm install -g now
```

And login there:

```shell
$ now login
provide your credentials
```

In the `now.json` file enter the proper name of your application:

```json
# now.json
{
    ...
    "name": "your-app-name",
    ...
}
```

Go to the `django_server.settings.development.py` file and edit `SERVER_URL` constant. Change `...redfish-server...` to the name you previously typed at the `now.json` file and `...guandjoy...` replace with your own ZEIT Now username, which you can find in [account settings](https://zeit.co/account)

```python
# django_server/settings/development.py
...
SERVER_URL = 'https://your-app-name-development.username.now.sh'
...
```

Paste the same URL to the `.env.devremote` file in the `landing-page` folder:

```shell
# landing-page/.env.devremote
...
GATSBY_SERVER_URL = "https://your-app-name-development.username.now.sh"
...
```

Same for `react-app`:

```shell
# react-app/.env.devremote
...
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL = "https://your-app-name-development.username.now.sh"
...
```

## AWS set up

The database and static files we serve by AWS RDS and S3 respectively, so if you don't have a functioning AWS account, please create it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/). They have a Free Tier, which is enough for our needs. You can use other services as well, but we don't cover their configurations here.

Go to [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html), copy and paste the value of your region into the `settings/development.py` file;

```python
# settings/development.py
...
# The AWS region to connect.
AWS_REGION = "eu-central-1"
...
```

- Go to [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users) and **create a new user** with **Programmatic access**.
- Create a group with **AmazonRDSFullAccess** and **AmazonS3FullAccess** policies. Add a created user there.
- Copy **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**. Paste them to the `settings/development.py` file

```python
# settings/development.py
...
# The AWS access key to use.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKIAR2BBJGZAVGG2RF6A"

# The AWS secret access key to use.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "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"
...
```

## AWS S3 bucket

S3 bucket is the place to collect static files. [Create it](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) with the next **Block public access** configurations:

- [ ] Block all public access
- [ ] Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
- [ ] Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
- [x] Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket policies
- [x] Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket policies

Copy and Paste the name of the S3 bucket to the `settings/development.py` file:

```python
# settings/development.py
...
S3_BUCKET = "server-development-static" # Put the name of your S3 bucket here
...
```

## AWS RDS set up

- [Create](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) PostgreSQL database. _We recommend to set up [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to effectively manage your RDS instances._
- Set `DATABASES` in the `settings/development.py` file:

```python
# settings/development.py
...
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'server_development', # dbname
        'USER': 'username', # master username
        'PASSWORD': 'MllVzrRbc3EvT3S', # master password
        'HOST': 'aws-postgres-rds.c7fqrmwomayj.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com', # Endpoint
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
...
```

## Deploy and prepare Django server

Start the virtual environment:

```shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Use our script to deploy:

```shell
python now.py
```

Your server should be live! Go to the browser and test it with a link you specified previously.

Apply migrations:

```shell
$ python -m django migrate --settings=django_server.settings.development
```

Create a superuser:

```shell
$ python -m django createsuperuser --settings=django_server.settings.development
```

Redfish sends emails to users, and there is should be a proper link. So please do the next:

- Log in to the Django admin as a superuser
- Go to `Sites` and edit the first instance
- Domain name set to `http://localhost:8000` and Display name to `localhost:8000.`
- Click save

## Run frontend development servers

You can run them withing 2 console windows, or, as we highly recommend, withing [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/.github/README.md) session.

- ### Start with terminal windows

Prepare 2 terminal instances and start 'landing-page' in first:

```shell
$ cd src/landing-page/
$ gatsby develop
```

And `react-app` in second, respectively:

```shell
$ cd src/react-app/
$ npm start
```

- ### Start with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/.github/README.md) [alternative and preferable way].

Execute the `tmux.devremote.py` script at the root folder:

```shell
$ python tmux.devremote.py
```

Read [tmux man](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1). Some basics to play with it:

- `ctrl+b` `w` - navigate through windows using `up` and `down` arrow keys;
- `ctrl+b` `d` - minimize tmux and save session;
- `$ tmux a` - back to tmux after minimize it;
- `ctrl+d` - terminate tmux and session;
- `ctrl+b` `[` - scroll through the content. Use `up` and `down` arrow keys and `esc` to exit mode;
- `ctrl+b` `c` - create new window.

You are ready to develop!
