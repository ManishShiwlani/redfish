# Environments

With redfish environments design, you can set up as many environments as you need.

- <TransitionLink to="/docs/environments/local-development">Local development environment</TransitionLink> is a point to start. It is easy to set up and allows you to create backend logic rapidly.

- <TransitionLink to="/docs/environments/serverless-development">Serverless development environment</TransitionLink> will save you CPU resources by running the server on ZEIT Now serverless host and increase frontend development process.

- <TransitionLink to="/docs/environments/staging">Staging environment</TransitionLink> is totally serverless. Test your code in the production context.

- <TransitionLink to="/docs/environments/production">Production environment</TransitionLink> is the same as staging and lives on a master branch. Be sure you test everything before merge.
