Redfish consist of the landing page, Google Keep clone application, and the server. The main dependencies are GatsbyJS, Create React App, GraphQL Apollo Client, Django, Graphene, and django-rest-auth.

Frontend and backend parts are hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/) respectively. For things like database and static files we use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

The API and data fetching are implemented with GraphQL. On a frontend we use [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and on a back â€“ [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/).
