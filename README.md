Redfish is a serverless boilerplate web application. It consist of a landing page (GatsbyJS), google keep clone application (CRA), and a server (Django).

Frontend and backend parts are hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/) respectively. For things like database and static files we use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

The API and data fetching are implemented with GraphQL. On a frontend we use [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and on a back -- [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/).
